# Steam power mod

# Main features:
General Idea:
Significantly higher building material cost, for significantly higher power yield compared to vanilla combustion generators


## Boilers
    Dimensions 2x2 / 3x3
    
    Heating up requires time
    Heat = 0-100%
    Start producing steam at 50%, produces 2% of max output for every 1% of additional heat

    Low pressure
        Heat up in half a day
        Fuel efficient
        Average power production
        -   Needs steel to build

    High Pressure
        Heat up in 2 days
        High output ~2.5x
        3x Fuel consumption
        -   Needs Plasteel
    
    Boiler upgrades?
        each upgrade is 1x2 in size, can have 4 max
        5-10% each?
        Linkables to improve
            Fuel efficiency
            Heating speed -> 25% speed instead? otherwise sounds just bad
            Steam output
    Fuel filter?

    Option to "roughly" ( 50%,75%,100%) control fuel usage & power generation, should only be worth using when a boiler is already at 100% heat

## Geothermal tap
    Creates static flow of Steam pressure from vents


## Turbines to produce power
    2 Buildings: Normal and Advanced
    Calculations in this documents are done only for normal variant
    Advanced version allows rotors to work at 2x the pressure & RPM, Maybe also faster spinup?
    Building Dimension 2x4 for both versions

    Cost:
        Normal: Steel & components
        Advanced: Steel, Plasteel & Advanced Components

    Different materials for structure?
    Or have different "rotor" materials?
        Something like buttons on the turbine object to install a rotor, which causes a pawn to grab materials and bring it there

    stats
        RPM
            how fast a rotor can spin
        Inertia
            How long it takes to spin up - and also how long it spins after steam cutoff
    
    Maybe also add "Dynamo" part? propably not
        Efficiency 
            Joules to watts

    Material stats
        Steel 
            Base Weight, base RPM 100%
        Plasteel
            Slightly lower (75%)Weight, Slghtly more than double RPM
        Uranium
            High Weight, just slightly higher rpm than steel 130%?, mainly due to cost?

## Pipe System
    Resource in pipes is just "Pressure", no storage

## Other mods integrations
    Dubs bad hygiene
        Use water to generate steam
        Heat exchanger to convert hot steam to heat network
        Maybe:
            Condenser addon to turbine, which generates water ( any maybe small amount of heat?), needs to be placed next to turbine
    Any big metal/alloy mod?
        More types of rotors

### Heating and Fuel usage
Not sure if using this, or just static numbers, might get too complicated

### Fuel stats
Fuel units used per day compared to vanilla generators
|          | Vanilla | LP 2x2 | LP 3x3 | HP 2x2 | HP 3x3 |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|     Wood |      22 | 15.4   | 46.2   |  35,2  | 105,6  |

|Max Pressure|   15MPa |      25MPa |    20MPa |      30MPa |
|MAX RPM     | 1500RPM |    3600RPM |  2400RPM |    7200RPM |

### Rotor Spinup Maths
Start to spin up when Min Pressure is supplied, however it will only increase the speed by 33% up to a max of (MinP / MaxP rounded to 1 dec)% of the max RPM
If the Actual Pressure is lower than the min, then the rotor will start to slow down

Formula
RPM Change per tick = (20000 * Weight) / Max_RPM * Curve_point_multiplier
Current MAX_RPM = Current_Pressure / MaxPressure

Pressurve curve points
|Pressure                    | Multiplier   |
|----------------------------|--------------|
|       0                    |         -1   |
| Min_Pres*0.33              |         -0.5 |
| Min_Pres*0.66              |         -0.2 |
| Min_Pres                   |          0   |
| (Max-Min)*0.33+Min         |          0.2 |
| (Max-Min)*0.66+Min         |          0.5 |
| Max_Pres                   |          1   |

## Power production
Simple RPM to Watts conversion?
1:1 ?
Means a LP boiler with steel turbine = 1.5kW
